# Unity-Snowboarder
a game I made in Unity about a snowboarder that has to reach the finish line, It includes special effects and sounds

I'm still new to making games so I'm not quite sure how am I supposed to effectively upload game projects on GitHub, if someone has useful advice to give I'm all ears!!
